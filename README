Gendev is not intended to replace, but to be a companion project to the SGDK
(Sega Genesis Development Kit).

Gendev exists to setup a Linux (or presumably other Unix) system for Sega
Genesis development.

==BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:==
{{{
    $ svn checkout http://gendev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gendev-read-only 
    $ cd gendev-read-only 
    $ make 
}}}
Woo hoo, tools are all setup. Now let's build sgdk ... 
{{{
    $ . ~/.gendev 
    $ cd gendev-read-only/sgdk 
    $ make install 
}}}
Now I want to create a project ... 
{{{
    $ cp gendev-read-only/sgdk/skeleton mycoolproject 
    $ cd mycoolproject 
}}}
*type type type* 
{{{
    $ make

==Troubleshooting and FAQ==
===makeinfo is missing===
Try installing the 'texinfo' package.  On Ubuntu this would be 'sudo apt-get
install texinfo'
===How do I build this on *BSD?===
Use gmake.  Try the following to build the framework: 
{{{
MAKE=gmake MGET=fetch gmake
}}}
And for sgdk
{{{
cd sgdk; gmake install
}}}
===This doesn't work/There is an obvious issue, you fool===
Please let me know and perhaps file an issue.


GENDEV - Genesis development environment for Linux.

This is not meant to replace the SGDK (code.google.com/p/sgdk) but to
assist setting up a working Genesis development environment on *Nix.


Some descriptions ->


 * gendev/Makefile 


Makefile for setting up the required build tools.  Running this is enough for
a basic development environment.


 * gendev/sgdk/Makefile

Makefile for setting up SGDK for use on Linux


 * gendev/sgdk/skeleton

Some basic files to assist in building SGDK project under Linux.
